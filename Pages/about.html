        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>
            Founded to uphold the traditional values of Shotokan Karate, 
            Shotokan Warriors was established with the purpose of building strong minds, 
            disciplined bodies and respectful individuals. Inspired by the teachings of Gichin Funakoshi, 
            the Dojo focuses on traditional kata, kihon (basics) and kumite (sparring) 
            while welcoming students of all ages. Over the years, the dojo has grown into a 
            community where dedication, perseverance and the warrior spirit are 
            cultivated both on and oA the mat. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The Dojo was founded in 2015 by Sensei (Grandmaster) Tony Yokozuno, a 5th dan black belt,
            with over 15 years of training under his belt.
